# ⚙️ ISE Intelligence Engine (Backend)

The central logic hub for the Kruthika R portfolio. This is a RESTful API designed to process data requests and simulate engineering environments.

## 🧠 The "Why" (Engineering Logic)
This repository exists to show the "brain" behind the website. Instead of hardcoding results, I engineered a server to handle logic independently. This demonstrates:
* **Data Processing:** A Sales Prediction model that calculates stock depletion dates.
* **Security Logic:** An authentication handshake simulating encrypted vault access.
* **Scalability:** The ability to serve multiple frontend clients from one cloud source.

## 🧪 API Endpoints
* `POST /api/predict`: Analyzes inventory data to forecast business risks.
* `POST /api/vault`: Validates cryptographic keys for secure data access.
* `GET /api/leads`: Simulates an automated data retrieval/scraping service.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.10
* **Web Framework:** Flask
* **Deployment:** Render (Cloud PaaS)
